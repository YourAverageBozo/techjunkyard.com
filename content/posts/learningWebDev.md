## HTML and CSS

I wanted a website because I wanted to have a unique place on the internet were I could write. So I decided to learn HTML and CSS. A couple of months prior I tried learning HTML and CSS and failed because I couldn't remember everything and I was overwhelmed so this time I didn't try yo memorize everything and just focused on memorizing the basics of it.This time I could right basic HTML and CSS in a day. Sure it was basic but it was all I really needed I did not plan to heavly use CSS on my website I wanted it to be more simple.

## Learning a Framework

From the start I did not want to use a large framework, I decided on a light and fast frame work called Hugo. Hugo is a fast framework that uses markdown for writting. Instead of writing a bunch of sytax I could write things in markdown making the process of making posts much faster. I read the documention and watched some guides online on how to set up a quick website. In no time I was able to make websites in minutes. 

## Making This Website and Hosting It

With this new skill of making quick small sites I was able to put together this site fairly quickly and write this post. I heard of a service called Netlify were you can import a repository from somthing like github or gitlab and host it on there servers. There is many ways to use Netlify but I chose the easy way that did not require me to add any Netlify files to my repository. After a little bit of clicking I made this website.
